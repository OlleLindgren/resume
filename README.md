# Resume
Nice seeing you here! This repo is mostly meant for me as a way of using version control with my resume building. The .pdf files are the exported resumes and the .indd files are the corresponding Adobe InDesign source files. If you're a recruiter, the default one is probably the one I've intended for you to look at. The others are mostly old versions, experiments with other layouts and things like that.

Have a great day!
