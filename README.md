# Resume
Nice seeing you here! This repo is mostly meant for me as a way of using version control with my resume building. The _pdf_ files are the exported resumes and the _indd_ files are the corresponding Adobe InDesign source files. 

If you're a recruiter, the one named __CV Default.pdf__ is probably the one I've intended for you to look at. The others are mostly old versions, experiments with other layouts and things like that.

Have a great day!
